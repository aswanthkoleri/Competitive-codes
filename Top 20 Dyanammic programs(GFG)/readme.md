# How the programs are stored? 

- All the programs are written in python and the file name is of the format ` %Question no%_%program type%.py `
- rec ----> is for recursive programs 
- dyn ----> is for dynammic programs

# Tutorials on the problems

The problems are done from a tutorial about the Top 20 Dynammic programs. Following is the link to the [Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-dynamic-programming-interview-questions/)
